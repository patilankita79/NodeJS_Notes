# NodeJS_Notes
 Node.js is a run-time environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.

<hr>

## What is Node.js?
<ol>
  <li>Node.js is a Javascript runtime that uses Chrome's V8 engine.</li>
  <li>V8 is an Open source Javascript engine written in C++ that take Javascript code and compiles into machine code. This engine is used inside of Node js and Chrome browser</li>
</ol>

## What you can do with Node.js applications?
<ol>
<li>Manipulate file system -> creating and removing folders</li>
<li>Create databases</li>
<li>Create web server</li>
</ol>

## Why Node.js?
<ol>
  <li>Node.js uses event driven, non-blocking I/O model</li>
  <li>Node.js is single threaded, means the application runs in a single thread</li>
</ol>
 
## Node JS Package Ecosystem - Node.js Package Manager(NPM)
<ol>
<li>NPM is the package manager for Javascript</li>
<li>NPM allows packages and modules for node</li>
<li>All 3rd party libraries or modules, we can get from NPM as per the requirement of our application. </li>
<li>Every 3rd party library present in NPM uses non-blocking I/O model</li>
</ol>

## NodeJS built-in modules 

Node modules are similar to JS libraries <br>
Complete list can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/"> here.</a>
Few built-in modules are mentioned in the following table.<br>

<table>
<th>Module</th>
<th>Description</th>
  <tr>
  <td>http</td>
  <td>To make node.js to act as HTTP Server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>https</td>
  <td>To make node.js to act as HTTPS server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>fs</td>
  <td>To handle the file system</td>

  <tr>
  <td>path</td>
  <td>To handle file path</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>events</td>
  <td>To handle events</td>

3. package.json is the main manifest file which should be present in the root of application. Package.json tells NPM how your package is &nbsp; &nbsp;structured and what to do to install it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;package.json can be set either manually or using command => npm init<br>

<ol>
<li>Modules(built-in Node modules or 3rd party library or your own files) can be used in program using <b>require</b> function (Anology:<i> Can be thought as <b>import</b> statement in Java</i>)</li>
